# Nicholas J. Songer - Final Project - Eric. J. Pogue - nicholasjsonger@lewisu.edu

Originally, what I had planned for this final project was a calculator that told you whether or not you should fly given a set of current weather data that you input. 

This is exactly what I delivered so I'm pleased that I got to acheive my goal of what I wanted to do for this project. Not only this, but I also handled invalid data, and routed users from a instruction screen to the calculator screen, so I did more than I expected. 

If I had more time, I would have liked to have gone more in depth with the results of the calculator, where you could input even more current weather data and get more detailed results about how your flight would go if you were cleared to fly. An example of such a result would be, "You can fly, but expect some bumps around 3500 feet." It also would have been cool to add weight & balance, but given my other finals I did not have time to implement that.
